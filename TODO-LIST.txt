** Was working on the test_ask.py and had to stop to implement the Task.generate() function.
In order to implement this, I need the agent list to pass to the generate() function.
Then I have to implement the AgentHandler class to get this list.
To return the list, I have to create example agents.
To be able to create example agents, I have to implement the tool decorator in the ToolAgent class.

[ ] Implement the agent tool decorator
[ ] Implement the example agents
[ ] Fix the Task.generate() function
[ ] Finish the test_ask.py
